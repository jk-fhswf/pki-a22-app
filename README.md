# Haar Cascade Evaluation Apps with Streamlit and Tkinter


In this project we developed an object detection App using Haar Cascade classifier in two different ways: one as web dashboard with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and one as desktop app using Tkinter. 

Here is a [demo](https://jk-fhswf-pki-a22-app-app-codcuk.streamlit.app/) of the Streamlit app deployed on the Streamlit cloud platform.

### Installing

We generally recommend installing the library inside a virtual environment

```
pip install git+https://github.com/jk-fhswf/pki-a22-app.git
```

### Executing program

The Streamlit app can be executed using the streamlit module: 
```
stremlit run app.py
```

For starting the Tkinter app use:

```
python app_tkinter.py
```

# Development

## Prerequisites

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as package manager. Please make sure to have poetry installed before.

## Dependencies

To setup a virtual environment with all necessary dependencies use the poetry package manager:

```
poetry install
```

This will create a virtual environment inside the folder ".venv". 

### Development Environment

All common development environments for python support the poetry package manager by default. We used Pycharm and VSCode.

## Export requirements file

If you want to use a different virtual environment you can export the dependencies using:
```
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
```
